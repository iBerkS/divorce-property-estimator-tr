This project was developed as an academic/portfolio project.

## ⚖ Legal Disclaimer

This application provides an approximate calculation based on general 
principles of Turkish Civil Code regarding acquired property regime.

It does NOT provide legal advice and does NOT establish an attorney-client relationship.

Real property division depends on:
- Court discretion
- Evidence
- Contribution shares
- Personal property exceptions
- Debts
- Special agreements
- Value increase shares
- Other legal factors

The results generated by this application are non-binding.
For definitive legal evaluation, consult a licensed attorney.
